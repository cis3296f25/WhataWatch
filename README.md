# WhataWatch
WhataWatch is the solution to movie nights that haven’t had a movie planned. WhataWatch will take an input of the user(s) letterboxd handle and a description of a movie they’d like to watch. It’ll then look at their logged movies and see what kind of movies they enjoy watching and what best matches the kind of movie they would like to watch. It will then suggest a list of potential movies with their descriptions for the user to read.
